# Find the Treasure Game

This is a simple interactive game where the player has to find the hidden treasure on a map. The game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fun and engaging experience.

## Game Description

The game displays a treasure map, and the player must click on the map to get closer to the hidden treasure. The distance from the treasure is given as a hint after each click. The game ends when the player finds the treasure or runs out of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click anywhere on the treasure map.
3. The game will show you a hint based on your distance to the treasure:
   - **Very hot**: You're almost there!
   - **Hot**: Getting closer.
   - **Warm**: You're on the right track.
   - **Cold**: Far away from the treasure.
   - **Very cold**: You're far, but you can still find it.
   - **Frozen**: You're too far to find the treasure.
4. You have a limited number of clicks (40 attempts) to find the treasure. If you run out of attempts, the game ends.
5. Once you find the treasure, the game will show a message with the number of clicks it took you to find it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the page and the interactive elements.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including distance calculation and hint generation.
