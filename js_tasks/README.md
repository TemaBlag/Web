# Collection of Web-based Projects

This repository contains a series of small web-based projects implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The projects focus on interactive elements and mathematical functions. Each project demonstrates different concepts, from encryption and decryption to remainder calculations.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [**TaraBarshchina**]()

A web-based project where the user can input text and choose to either encrypt or decrypt it using a simple cipher technique. This project allows users to experiment with encoding and decoding messages.

### 2. [**Custom Cipher Key Creation**]()

This project allows users to create a custom cipher key by assigning letters to specific characters. The key is then used to encrypt or decrypt messages.

### 3. [**Remainder Calculation**]()

A project focused on calculating the remainders of a function `y = x * (x + 1)` for a given value of `n`. It also allows users to input different types of numbers (prime numbers, product of primes, or prime raised to a power) and observe the corresponding results.

### 4. [**Remainder Calculation for Function y = x * (x + 1)**]()

Another remainder calculation project but with a different mathematical function `y = x * (x + 1)` with specific user input options (prime numbers, product of primes, or prime powers).

### 5. [**Remainder Calculation with User Input for Prime Numbers**]()

This is a further iteration of the remainder calculation project, where the user works with a customized mathematical expression `y = x * (x + 1)` and is able to input a variety of prime-related numbers.
