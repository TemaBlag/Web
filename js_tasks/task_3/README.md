# Remainder Count

## Overview
This project calculates the remainders of a mathematical function `y = kx + b` for different values of `x` based on user input. The user can input the values of the parameters `k`, `b`, and `n`. The tool then calculates the remainders of the values produced by the equation when divided by `n` and displays the remainders as well as the results of the division.

## Features
- **User Input**: Allows users to input values for the parameters `k`, `b`, and `n`.
- **Calculate Remainders**: Calculates the remainders of the equation `y = kx + b` for values of `x` from 1 to `n`.
- **Display Results**: Shows the remainders and the calculated values of `y` for each value of `x`.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Input the Values**:
   - Enter values for the parameters `k`, `b`, and `n` in the provided text fields.
   - `k` is the coefficient of `x`, `b` is the constant term, and `n` is the number for which the remainders will be calculated.
3. **Calculate**:
   - Click the **"Принять"** (Accept) button to calculate the remainders.
4. **View Results**:
   - The remainders and the calculated values will be displayed on the page below the input fields.

## Files
- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the webpage and the input fields for the parameters `k`, `b`, and `n`.
- `style.css`: The CSS file used for styling the layout, table, and buttons.
- `logic.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the calculation of the remainders and updates the UI.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure of the webpage and input forms.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and making the user interface visually appealing.
- **JavaScript (jQuery)**: Used for handling the logic behind calculating the remainders and dynamically updating the page.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Enter the values of `k`, `b`, and `n` into the respective fields.
4. Click the **"Принять"** (Accept) button to calculate and view the remainders.
