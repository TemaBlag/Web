# Tarabarshchyna Cipher

## Overview
This project implements a simple encryption and decryption tool for transforming text into a "Tarabarshchyna" cipher. The tool allows users to input text, encrypt it with a custom algorithm, and then decrypt the text back to its original form.

The Tarabarshchyna cipher is a playful cipher used in some Russian linguistic games where characters are transformed in a simple, systematic way.

## Features
- **Text Input**: Users can input text that needs to be encrypted or decrypted.
- **Encryption**: Converts the plain text into a ciphered version.
- **Decryption**: Converts the ciphered text back to its original form.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is simple and responsive, with text areas and buttons for interaction.
