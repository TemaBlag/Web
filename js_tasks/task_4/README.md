# Remainder Count for Mathematical Functions

## Overview
This project calculates the remainders of the function `y = x * x` when divided by different values of `n` based on user input. The user can select one of the following scenarios for the variable `n`:
1. Prime number.
2. Product of prime numbers.
3. Prime number raised to a power.

The tool will calculate the remainders for each scenario and display them on the page.

## Features
- **User Input**: Allows users to input values for the variable `n` and choose one of the three scenarios.
- **Calculate Remainders**: The function `y = x * x` is calculated for values of `x` (from 1 to `n`), and the remainders of the values produced are calculated for each scenario.
- **Display Results**: Shows the remainders and the calculated values of `y` for each value of `x`.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Input the Values**:
   - Enter values for `n` and choose one of the following scenarios:
     1. A prime number.
     2. A product of prime numbers.
     3. A prime number raised to a power.
3. **Click the "Принять" Button**: This will calculate the remainders and display the results.
4. **View Results**:
   - The remainders and results of the calculation will be displayed on the page.

## Files
- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the webpage, including input fields for the variable `n` and buttons for calculation.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the layout and user interface.
- `logic.js`: The JavaScript file that processes the input, performs calculations, and displays the results.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure of the webpage and input forms.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the layout and elements.
- **JavaScript (jQuery)**: Used for handling the logic behind the calculations and dynamically updating the page content.
